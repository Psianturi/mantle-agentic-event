# ASAJU 

ASAJU is a **testnet prototype for autonomous knowledge agents**. A user creates an agent with an independent wallet and gas reserve; the agent analyses selected YouTube content, retains a learning history, and records an on-chain attestation of that work.

The original **MAEF** contract name remains in source code and deployed contracts.

> **Live application:** [asaju.vercel.app](https://asaju.vercel.app)  
> **Current network scope:** Mantle Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia. ASAJU does not handle real funds and is not financial advice.

## The Problem

AI users who understand the basics of blockchain learn from a fast-moving stream of technical videos, talks, and livestreams. Researcher and community-lead workflows are the initial focus, but the product is designed for any user who wants an AI agent with a persistent, inspectable learning trail. Conventional summaries are ephemeral: they have no persistent agent identity, no durable record of how knowledge accumulated, and no way to distinguish a one-off answer from an agent's continuing research.

## What ASAJU Builds

ASAJU gives a topic-focused agent a durable research workflow across supported networks. Mantle and Ethereum are current testnet deployments; neither is positioned as the product's primary blockchain.

1. **Create an agent** with an independent address, a configurable niche, personality, and testnet gas reserve.
2. **Analyse YouTube content** submitted by a user or discovered through opt-in Auto Scout.
3. **Store the learning record** in the agent's Firestore memory and write the submitted event data plus AI summary to an on-chain NFT record.
4. **Build capability over time** through event history, skill scores, cross-event wisdom reports, and strategic proposals.
5. **Keep consequential actions human-controlled**: strategic proposals require approval before they are recorded on-chain.

The product is not an NFT factory. The NFT is a verifiable record of an agent's learning action; the product is the agent's persistent knowledge workflow.

## What Is Verified On-Chain

The smart contract verifies that an authorised signer minted an NFT and records the event data supplied in that transaction: agent wallet, event title and URL, platform, summary, niche, timestamp, and evolving agent statistics.

It does **not** independently prove that a video was watched, that an event occurred, or that an AI summary is objectively correct. For that reason, this README calls the asset an **on-chain learning attestation** or **agent analysis record**. "Proof of Attendance" is the contract's historical name, not a claim of independently verified attendance.

## Current Scope and Status

| Capability | Current status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Agent creation and testnet funding | Implemented | Users invoke `spawnAgent()` from a compatible wallet. |
| YouTube analysis | Implemented | HTTPS URLs are restricted to `youtube.com`, `www.youtube.com`, and `youtu.be`. Transcript retrieval falls back to metadata-only analysis when no transcript is available. |
| On-chain learning attestation | Implemented | Stores submitted event data and AI summary through `mintAttendanceNFT()`. |
| Autonomous signing (Mode B) | Implemented | A spawned agent wallet can sign its own mint transaction using its own gas reserve. |
| Auto Scout | Implemented | Opt-in; Cloud Scheduler runs discovery on each agent's configured cooldown. |
| Agent chat, wisdom reports, and proposals | Implemented | Powered by stored event memory and Gemini. Proposal recording is human-in-the-loop. |
| Breeding and lineage | Implemented | Guarded backend workflow plus an on-chain breed record; parent agents must share a chain. |
| Multi-chain testnet support | Implemented | Mantle Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia. Ethereum's spawn-to-Mode-B mint path has been verified on its deployed V4 contract. |
| Wisdom Digest minting | Product decision pending | The proposed shift from one event per NFT to periodic synthesis is not implemented. |
| Autonomous financial execution | Not active | `AUTONOMOUS_VAULT_ADDRESS` is not configured. No production trading or real-fund execution exists. |

Deprecated contract addresses are intentionally omitted from this product overview. Keep migration history in deployment documentation rather than presenting it as an active user choice.

### Backend Continuous Deployment

The source repository is [`Psianturi/asaju`](https://github.com/Psianturi/asaju). Every push to its `main` branch triggers the externally managed Cloud Build trigger `asaju-cloud-run-main-deploy`:

```text
GitHub push to main -> Cloud Build -> Artifact Registry -> Cloud Run
```

Cloud Build builds the root `Dockerfile`, pushes the resulting image to Artifact Registry, and updates the `mantle-agentic-event` service in `asia-southeast1`. The Cloud Run service name remains `mantle-agentic-event` for runtime continuity; it is independent of the GitHub repository name.

To verify a deployment, check the Cloud Build build associated with the pushed commit, then confirm the Cloud Run revision has the matching `commit-sha` label. The `Backend Tests / pytest` GitHub Action is a separate quality check and does not deploy Cloud Run.

## Agent Lifecycle

```text
SPAWN    User creates an agent record, then calls spawnAgent() on the selected testnet.
      The contract registers the wallet and transfers its configured gas provision.

LEARN    The user submits a permitted YouTube URL, or enables Auto Scout.
      ASAJU fetches available transcript content, asks Gemini for a concise summary,
      then classifies the content category for the agent's skill profile.

ATTEST  The agent wallet self-signs the mint in Mode B when funded and registered.
      The contract stores an on-chain learning attestation; Firestore stores richer
      agent state, event history, scout logs, and proposal context.

EVOLVE  Event history raises the agent's level and unlocks cross-event reporting,
      human-reviewed strategic proposals, and Neural Fusion eligibility.

GOVERN  A human reviews a strategic proposal before the backend records its approved
      proposal hash on-chain. Autonomous financial execution is not enabled.

FUSE    Eligible agents on the same chain create an offspring record with lineage,
      inherited context, and an independently funded agent wallet.
```

## Agent Maturity Model

Agent levels are derived from accumulated successful mint records. They are a transparent progress signal, not a measure of AI capability or a guarantee of decision quality.

| Level | Records required | Current meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| 1 | 0 | Agent identity, YouTube analysis, and on-chain learning attestations. |
| 2 | 2 | A growing event history and skill-score profile. |
| 3 | 4 | Strategic Consult and guarded Neural Fusion eligibility. |
| 4 | 6 | Cross-event Wisdom Report and deeper lineage context. |
| 5 | 8 | Milestone for future policy-constrained execution; no autonomous financial action is active. |

---

## Operational Limits and Guardrails

- **Spawn quota:** maximum **3 directly spawned agents** per wallet per supported network. Bred offspring do not consume this quota.
- **Breeding constraints:** parent level 3+, maximum 3 breedings per parent, 24-hour cooldown, same-chain parents, and no self-breeding.
- **Mode B gas autonomy:** agents need native-token balance for autonomous signing. A low balance requires a user-funded top-up before retry.
- **Auto Scout:** disabled by default and only runs for agents whose owner opted in. Scheduler requests are OIDC-protected.
- **Content scope:** the backend accepts HTTPS YouTube URLs only. Luma, Eventbrite, and Zoom integrations were removed because they did not have end-to-end integrations.

---

## Verification and Known Gaps

### Verified after the YouTube-only cleanup

- Cloud Build successfully installed backend dependencies in the production Python 3.11 image, including `web3` and `eth_account`.
- The deployed Cloud Run revision booted without import traceback, reached FastAPI startup completion, and exposes a healthy `/health` response.
- This verifies the build and runtime boot path. It does **not** yet prove that the post-cleanup production write path (`POST /api/v1/event/attend` -> Gemini -> mint -> Firestore) has completed a fresh successful transaction.

### Verified this cleanup round (9 Sep 2026)

- **Proposal approval now requires an owner-wallet signature.** `POST /approval-challenge` issues a single-use, 10-minute nonce bound to the proposal hash and the agent's recorded owner wallet. `POST /approve` recovers the signer from an EIP-191 signature, checks it against both the claimed wallet and the recorded owner, then atomically consumes the challenge before calling Web3/KMS — a replayed signature cannot trigger re-execution. Verified with a real local `pytest` run (not just static checks): 15/15 backend tests pass, including two new regression tests asserting an invalid signature never reaches `web3_service` and a replayed nonce is rejected with `401`.
- **IPFS removed entirely**, not just disabled. The removed browser-side service built an Infura Basic Auth header from `VITE_IPFS_PROJECT_ID`/`VITE_IPFS_PROJECT_SECRET` — since Vite inlines every `VITE_*` value into the production bundle, those credentials shipped to every visitor. Confirmed via a production build diff (values present in `dist/assets/*.js` before the fix, absent after). The feature was never wired to the production mint path (V4's `tokenURI()` is level-based, not per-token), so removal has no functional loss.
- **All simulated/fabricated success states removed from the frontend:** the old proposal "Sign & Execute" modal only ran a `setTimeout` and never called a wallet; a legacy handler generated a random fake transaction hash on approval; the Marketplace's Buy/List flow mutated local state after a delay with no wallet interaction; a gas-price display generated its numbers with `Math.random()`. All of these have been deleted rather than left dormant, so they cannot be reactivated with a stray UI change.

### Remaining work

1. **End-to-end write-path proof:** execute and record a reproducible YouTube attend -> Mode B mint -> Firestore smoke test on the current deployment.
2. **`reject_proposal` authorization:** the same challenge/signature mechanism used for approval has not yet been applied to rejection. Impact is low (no funds or keys are touched), but the inconsistency should be closed.
3. **Wallet compatibility:** improve injected EIP-1193 provider selection and replace MetaMask-specific UI language where appropriate.
4. **Metric reconciliation:** `total_wisdom_nfts` and `total_events_attended` currently come from different Firestore sources and should not be compared as equivalent counts.
5. **Frontend maintainability:** [`src/App.tsx`](src/App.tsx) remains a large state-and-handler surface and has no frontend test suite.
6. **Wisdom Digest decision:** periodic synthesis is a proposed product direction, not a deployed feature. Its trigger, cadence, and scope must be decided before implementation.
7. **Shared gas-status cache:** each agent card polls its own gas balance independently; a shared per-`(wallet, chain)` cache would cut redundant backend/RPC calls when the same agent renders in multiple places.



---

### Strategic Consult — Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

At Level 3+, Gemini can generate a proposal from an agent's stored event history. A human reviews the proposal before the service records an approval hash through the contract's `MINTER_ROLE` flow.

An approved proposal increases the agent's on-chain heritage score by 5, capped at 100. The contract records the proposal hash and approval event; proposal text, source context, and rejection feedback remain in Firestore.

This is governance-assisted recommendation, not autonomous execution. It must not be represented as investment advice or an automated trading feature.

---

### Neural Fusion (Agent Breeding)

Two eligible agents on the same chain can create an offspring. The contract persists a breed record, while the backend creates an independent wallet, lineage metadata, and a limited inherited event context in Firestore.

The backend enforces ownership, maturity, same-chain, quota, cooldown, and idempotency guardrails before creating the offspring record. The chain confirms the breeding payment and offspring key; it does not independently reproduce every backend eligibility rule. This distinction is intentional and should remain clear to users.

---

### Auto Scout

Cloud Scheduler calls an OIDC-protected endpoint for agents whose owners enabled Auto Scout. The Secretary discovery path searches YouTube by the agent's niche, filters previously seen URLs, and asks Gemini to rank a candidate. The current logic uses relevance and gas-aware thresholds before attempting an attestation.

Every decision is written as a Firestore scout log. Owners can enable or disable the feature and set the scout interval. Manual attendance does not yet use the same quality gate; that gap is one reason the proposed Wisdom Digest architecture must be designed before expanding mint volume.

---

### Skill Scores

Each agent has a fixed starting niche, but `skill_scores` tracks the categories detected from successful event summaries. The score currently rises by one for each successful mint in the detected category. It is an explainable activity count, not an AI-quality, financial-performance, or expertise score.

---

### Wisdom Reports

Agents with stored event summaries can request an off-chain Gemini cross-event report. Reports include event-grounded observations and strategic prompts; they are not minted automatically and are not financial advice.

---

### Memory Echoes (Agent Chat)

Agent chat is grounded with the event summaries and lineage context stored for that agent. The source material remains off-chain in Firestore, which allows richer context than the contract stores but also means the response is a service-generated interpretation rather than an on-chain fact.

---

## Sub-Agent Architecture

The product models four work roles. Secretary, Scribe, and Mint-Master correspond to implemented discovery, summarisation, and transaction steps. Social-Lite is an interface/conceptual role and should not be presented as a live social-network integration.

| Sub-Agent | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Secretary** | YouTube discovery, URL resolution, and Auto Scout decision support |
| **Scribe** | Transcript retrieval and Gemini summary generation |
| **Social-Lite** | Conceptual future role for community signal analysis |
| **Mint-Master** | Gas-aware transaction coordination and NFT minting |

## Architecture and Trust Boundaries

```text

                        | dashboard and user-initiated calls   | user pays spawn / breed testnet fees

      |  Gemini: summary, chat, report, scoring     | proposal hashes
      |  YouTube: discovery and transcript source   |
      |  KMS + Secret Manager: managed service keys |
      v

```

**On-chain:** registration, NFT ownership, event fields submitted during minting, agent statistics, breed records, and proposal hashes.  
**Off-chain:** video retrieval, Gemini outputs, richer memory, agent configuration, quality decisions, lineage narrative, and service-managed key operations.

This is a managed autonomy model. ASAJU creates a distinct wallet for each agent, but the service encrypts its key with GCP KMS and decrypts it only to sign authorised operations. It is therefore inaccurate to call the model user self-custody; users do not provide their personal wallet seed phrase to ASAJU, but the service controls the agent key under its cloud IAM policy.

## Smart Contract — MAEFDynamicNFTV4

The contract source lives in [`contracts/contracts/MAEFNFTV4.sol`](contracts/contracts/MAEFNFTV4.sol). It handles agent registration, gas provision, learning-attestation minting, agent-level statistics, breeding records, and proposal approval records.

Deployments are compatible but not identical. Ethereum Sepolia uses the fee-configurable V4 deployment. The active Mantle Sepolia deployment predates the mutable-fee upgrade and is read through legacy immutable fee getters by the backend compatibility layer. Product copy must not imply that every active deployment supports identical administrative controls.

| Chain | Address | Deployment behavior |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| Mantle Sepolia (5003) | [`0x66fD...c9419`](https://explorer.sepolia.mantle.xyz/address/0x66fD8b5411856D42c08D9356e879a6e7dF0c9419) | Legacy-compatible fee getters |
| Ethereum Sepolia (11155111) | [`0x9FEF...a80f4`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x9FEF11E45cFD550b33F13A31E8d80BE61cda80f4) | Fee-configurable V4 |

Adding a new chain requires a deployment entry plus matching configuration in [`src/lib/blockchain/chains.ts`](src/lib/blockchain/chains.ts) and [`backend/core/config.py`](backend/core/config.py).

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `spawnAgent(agentWallet)` | Registers agent, provisions `agentProvision` in gas reserve, sets `isAgentSpawned=true` |
| `spawnBredAgent(agentWallet, offspringId)` | Links offspring to BreedRecord, activates Mode B for offspring |
| `mintAttendanceNFT(...)` | Proof-of-Attendance NFT — dual-auth: `MINTER_ROLE` OR spawned agent self-signs |
| `breedAgents(p1, p2, offspringId, gen, score)` | Records breed on-chain, emits `AgentsBred` event. Both parents must be on the same chain. |
| `recordExecutedProposal(agentWallet, hash)` | HITL governance — MINTER_ROLE only, +5 Heritage Score |
| `setFees(spawnFee, agentProvision)` / `setBreedCost(cost)` | Owner-only economics calibration, atomic with an invariant so `agentProvision` can never exceed `spawnFee` |
| `getAgentStats(wallet)` | Returns full AgentStats struct |

**Key Events:**
- `NFTMinted(tokenId, agentWallet, eventTitle, agentName, agentLevel, timestamp)`
- `AgentsBred(user, offspringKey, parent1Wallet, parent2Wallet, generation, heritageScore, cost)`
- `WisdomUnlocked(agentWallet, timestamp)`
- `ProposalExecuted(agentWallet, proposalHash, proposalsApprovedTotal, heritageScoreAfter)`

**Roles:**
- Deployer `0xe52bb4B913B83A71d0d2deD47683B1154bf2560b` — `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`
- Minter Service `0xCBA7951a8b5AE81303AC5E1017e34bF50A342D22` — `MINTER_ROLE`

---

## Transaction Signing and Custody

### Mode B — Agent wallet signs

After `spawnAgent()` registers and funds the wallet, the backend decrypts the KMS-protected agent key in memory and uses it to sign `mintAttendanceNFT()`. The independent agent wallet pays the transaction gas from its provisioned testnet balance.

The regular Mode B attendance path is intentionally strict: a low-balance or unauthorised agent produces a structured failure rather than silently spending the minter service's funds. The owner can top up the agent wallet and retry.

### Mode A — Service wallet signs

The minter service wallet holds `MINTER_ROLE` and performs administrative operations such as `recordExecutedProposal()` and bred-agent activation. It can support explicit administrative minting, but it is not the normal signer for a funded Mode B agent.

### Custody statement

Agent wallets are independent from a user's connected wallet, but their keys are service-managed and KMS-protected. They are not exportable user seed phrases or non-custodial user wallets. This model is appropriate for the current testnet prototype; mainnet use requires explicit custody, authorization, recovery, and incident-response policies.

## Evidence for Review

- **Application:** [ASAJU AI](https://asaju.vercel.app)
- **Runtime liveness:** [Cloud Run health](https://mantle-agentic-event-21898396920.asia-southeast1.run.app/health)
- **Contracts:** [Mantle Sepolia explorer](https://explorer.sepolia.mantle.xyz/address/0x66fD8b5411856D42c08D9356e879a6e7dF0c9419) and [Ethereum Sepolia explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x9FEF11E45cFD550b33F13A31E8d80BE61cda80f4)

The production Python 3.11 container has successfully built and booted after the YouTube-only cleanup. A fresh production write-path transaction after that cleanup remains the next evidence artifact to publish: YouTube source -> Gemini summary -> Mode B mint -> Firestore record.

## Roadmap and Decision Gates

1. **Publish a reproducible write-path proof:** record the source URL, transaction hash, token ID, and persisted event record from one current production run.
2. **Finish user authorization hardening:** proposal approval is wallet-signature-gated and verified (see above); rejection and any future mutable routes still need the same treatment, plus distributed rate limiting once Cloud Run scales beyond one instance.
3. **Build the Market Data Layer:** CoinGecko + CoinMarketCap-backed price/sentiment context for agent research, cached server-side (keys live in GCP Secret Manager, never in `VITE_*`).
4. **Decide Wisdom Digest before building it:** choose time-based, threshold-based, or hybrid triggering; choose a cadence; and decide whether the unit is per agent or per agent-and-topic. No digest implementation has started.
5. **Design policy-constrained execution only after the above:** no real-fund trading or autonomous treasury action is currently enabled. `AUTONOMOUS_VAULT_ADDRESS` remains intentionally unset.
6. **Improve product reliability:** wallet compatibility, metric reconciliation, shared gas-status cache, `App.tsx` decomposition, and a frontend test suite.
7. **Navigation/IA redesign:** deferred until Wisdom Digest and Market Data Layer are settled, so the dashboard structure is designed once for the product's near-final shape rather than twice.
